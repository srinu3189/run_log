A project I'm using to get more familiar with Cucumber, RSpec, Ruby, and Rails.  At some point this might serve as my running log, but the product owner is kind of a jerkface.

TODO:

Extract "export" function to ExportsRuns class with its own specs
Think about making a LogBook class to slim down the controller and model
Learn how to do controller specs well
UI Work
Get it working on Heroku so I can use it
Travis CI
Graphs (HighCharts?)
